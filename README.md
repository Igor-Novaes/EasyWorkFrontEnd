<h1>Libraries used</h1>

<h3>Chakra</h3>
I commonly use Material UI as a component library, but I chose to use Chakra, as I find it simpler for small applications<br><br>

<h3>RouterRouter<h3>
For the creation of the routes I chose to use react-router-dom because it is the most common and the most used for the manipulation of the routes<br><br>

<h1>Project Structure</h1>
<h2>The project, in addition to the default folders, has four folders with sub-folders and files</h2><br><br>

<h3>Components</h3>
Here are all the reusable components of the application<br><br>

<h3>Pages</h3>
I separated this folder to put the two pages that the application has<br><br>

<h3>Routes</h3>
Here is the configuration of the routes in the browser that the application has<br><br>
